# Events and their generation in MadGraph for the end product l+ vl l- vl~ b b~

## hh

generate p p > h h, h > w+ w- > l+ vl l- vl~, h > b b~

## Reasons

As the M_{H} < 2 M_{W}, one of the W has to be off shell, 
and so to not force it to go onshell, we describe it as a 
decay method rather than an intermediate particle that is 
generated

## tW + j

define pb = p b b~
define wx = w+ w-
define lx = l+ l-
define vx = vl vl~
define jx = j b b~
define bx = b b~

generate pb pb > tx wx jx, wx > lx vx, (tx > wx bx, wx > lx vx)

## Reasons

The end product needs one more b than what can be provided by tW and 
thus the process is tW + j. As both the cases where t or t~ can give the 
same background, we define all multiparticles to give both the particle and 
its antipartice.

For the generation of tW without a t t~ intermediate, a gluon and a b jet 
is required and so it is added to the particle definition.

## tt~

generate p p > t t~ > l+ l- vl vl~ b b~

## Reasons

This is the simplest generation background with no complications (That I know of)

## tt~h

generate p p > t t~ h, (t > b w+, w+ > l+ vl), (t~ > b~ w-, w- > l- vl~)

## tau+tau-bb~

generate p p > ta+ ta- b b~, (ta+ > vt~ w+, w+ > l+ vl), (ta- > vt w-, w- > l- vl~)

## Reasons
This is the only decay channel known (by me) which gets close to the signal decay.

## l+l-bj

generate p p > l+ l- b jx

## Reasons
jx is added to include b jet as the final wanted decay contains two b jets

## jjl+l-vv~

generate p p > jx jx l+ l- vl vl~

## Problems

Takes a long time to process everything.

## tt~V

define v = w+ w- z

generate p p > t t~ v, (t > b w+, w+ > l+ vl), (t~ > b~ w-, w- > l- vl~)
